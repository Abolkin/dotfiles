## ✔️ Installation
Presuming you're starting from a live boot with nothing yet done to your machine, you'll want to install NixOS on your machine from a **minimal installation**.

Once done, clone the repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/toxocious/dotfiles.git
```

## Notice
**Do NOT run the installation script as an administrator.**

Doing so will cause directories to potentially be created in the wrong place.

Ths install script will likely take several minutes.

The installer will create symlinks and overwrite existing files.
> Please backup your current configs before installing.
